# Digital Forensics & Incident Response Journey

## Purpose

I’m focusing on DFIR because it’s a versatile skill that applies across both criminal and enterprise investigations, and it gives structure to my curiosity instead of letting me wander through cybersecurity. I enjoy uncovering hidden details and building timelines, which connects well with experience from my current role. My goal is to develop deep technical knowledge while being able to explain complex investigations in a simple, authentic way. I’m documenting this journey to show consistent growth, build meaningful connections, and create opportunities through curiosity and initiative rather than just applications. I don’t aim to know everything — I aim to keep learning.

## Areas of Interest

Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my foundations by studying operating systems and file systems so I can properly understand how artifacts are created and stored before diving deeper into logs and forensic tools. I’m especially interested in host-based investigations, evidence collection, preservation, and clear documentation throughout the incident response process. Long term, I aim to expand into deeper Windows analysis as well as mobile and cloud forensics.

Long term, I aim to specialize in mobile forensics and cloud forensics.

## Roadmap

Phase 1 – Foundations
Study the Windows boot process, file system structure, and core OS internals such as the registry and event logs to understand how artifacts are created and stored.

Phase 2 – Applied Practice
Build lab environments in virtual machines and begin using forensic tools to simulate investigations. Focus on understanding what the tools are showing rather than just running them.

Phase 3 – Documentation & Communication
Document completed labs through written reports and walkthrough videos to strengthen both technical clarity and communication skills.

## Philosophy

I strive to be a learn-it-all instead of a know-it-all and the biggest part of being a learn-it-all is admitting that I don't know it all but I can sho as hell learn it. Once my curiosity is sparked, I tend to ask many questions on how and why something work. The more I can better my understanding about topics and people, the more I can contribute to projects I take part in as well as the relationships I build with people. 

## Structure of This Repository

* `/progress-log` – Weekly or milestone updates
* `/labs` – Hands-on investigations and tool walkthroughs

## Use of AI

I use AI as a tutor and research assistant to help clarify concepts, challenge misunderstandings, and structure my thoughts more coherently. It helps me stay efficient by asking guiding questions and organizing ideas, but all content is based on my understanding and is reviewed and adjusted by me before being posted. When applicable, I will link the specific discussions that supported each update. AI is a learning accelerator in this process — not a shortcut to fabricate knowledge.
